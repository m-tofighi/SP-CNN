The python version of test code and trained network models (checkpoints) provided here.

How to run: 

 	1- Download the trained network models (checkpoint) for each dataset,
	
 	2- Modify the directories to the paths containing the trained model and test data,
	
 	3- Specify a path to save the outputs
	
	4- For assessment we used the same Matlab code provided by Sirinukunwattana et al.
