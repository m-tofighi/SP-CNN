The SP-CNN paper presented in ICIP-2018 in Athens, Greece. Now you can download it from IEEE Xplore at:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8451797

The python version of test code and trained network models (checkpoints) provided here.

How to run: 
 	1- Download the trained network models (checkpoint) for each dataset,
 	2- Modify the directories to the paths containing the trained model and test data,
 	3- Specify a path to save the outputs
	4- For assessment we used the same Matlab code provided by Sirinukunwattana et al.
